## Background

The purpose of cPortfolio was to create a platform that allows users to create and send a portfolio that allowed them to express their skills and capabilities to prospective employers, educators and other people of interest. The features and development of this project was created with respect to our client requirements. The main goal of this project was to allow users the ability to customize and tailor a portfolio page with specific content relevant to the jobs they are applying for, which is achieved through the creation of unique share pages.
